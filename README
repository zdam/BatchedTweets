Batched Tweets - turns real-time Twitter into batched Twitter.


This is a website that only lets you retrieve your tweets every 30 minutes.

If you try more frequently than that, nothing is displayed.

Watch your productivity soar!

Tweets are displayed in a grid covering the entire screen, so you spend more time reading and less time scrolling.

Simply click on a Tweet to open it in Twitter so you can perform whatever actions on it that you like.


Currently, this leverages www.SuperTweet.net as a twitter proxy to avoid having to do the OAuth dance.

You will need to set up a SuperTweet acount and ajust the web.config appSettings.

Long term, this needs to be changed to support OAuth, pull requests are welcome..
